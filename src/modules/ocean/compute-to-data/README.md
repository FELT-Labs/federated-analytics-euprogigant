# Compute-to-Data (C2D)

The most basic scenario for a Publisher is to provide access to the datasets they own or manage. However, a Publisher may offer a service to execute some computation on top of their data.

- The data never leaves the Publisher enclave.
- It's not necessary to move the data; the algorithm is sent to the data.
- Having only one copy of the data and not moving it makes it easier to be compliant with data protection regulations.
